There is a special flag when run `pugo`:

    $./pugo --debug

It watches `source` directory as default. But when `--debug`, it watches `template` too. So when template changes, it rebuilds either. That's useful when you creating new theme.

Meanwhile, in debug mode, the log lines are more, to record all running information.
